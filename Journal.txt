(The time I wrote this was on the ninth, and then I saw your udpate where every group member needs to submit their own so I copy pasted what I wrote in docs)

My sole use of AI this week was creating my profile with Claude, and after the fact, asking claude about some overall details of the data pipeline. It gave me some key components, those being Data Sources, Ingestion, Processing/Transformation, Storage, and Destination.
Claude also informed me of some common pipeline patterns, those being Batch Processing, Real-Time/Streaming, and ETL vs ELT. Along with some of the benefits overall of the pipeline.

This week I used AI to help better understand the SQL language. I was stuck on my assignment for class (AI is permitted when you're stuck, and can'g get help otherwise.) and I used Claude to give me a better understanding of what I needed to change in order to finish that assignment. I needed to use the %% function in order to search for all results that would have the string "night" in it.

This week my main use was once again for my SQL learning. We learned about new commands in our class, and I struggled to understand some of them, so I looked to Claude for help. I also used it to help with some of my week three exercises, I needed some debugging done and made some silly mistakes that took me too long to find out. My error being a typo. I also needed inspiration for a different class, I couldn't think of ways to make the schedule of classes have more or better filters so I used Claude.
